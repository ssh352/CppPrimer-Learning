Chapter8 The IO Library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.1 The IO Classes

##### IO library types and headers

| Header     | Type                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `iostream` | `istream`, `wistream` reads from a stream           |
|            | `ostream`, `wostream` writes to a stream            |
|            | `iostream`, `wiostream` reads and writes a stream   |
| `fstream`  | `ifstream`, `wifstream` reads from a file           |
|            | `ofstream`, ... writes to a file                    |
|            | `fstream`, ... reads and writes a file              |
| `sstream`  | `istringstream` ... reads from a string (in memory) |
|            | `ostringstream` ... writes to a string              |
|            | `stringstream`, ... reads and writes a string       |

`ifstream` and `istringstream` are inherit from `istream`

#### 8.1.1 No Copy or Assign for IO Objects

#### 8.1.2 Condition States

| IO Library Condition State |                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stream::iostate`          | a machine-dependent integral type that represent the condition state |
| `stream::badbit`           | `iostate` value used to indicate that a stream is corrupted          |
| `stream::failbit`          | indicate that an IO operation failed                                 |
| `stream::eofbit`           | a stream hit end-of-file                                             |
| `stream::goodbit`          | not in an error state. guaranteed to be zero                         |
| s.eof()                    | true if `eofbit` in the stream s is set                              |
| s.fail()                   | if `failbit` or `badbit` is set                                      |
| s.bad()                    | if `badbit` is set                                                   |
| s.good()                   | if s is in valid state                                               |
| s.clear()                  | Reset all condition values to valid state. return void               |
| s.clear(flags)             | Reset the condition of s to flags (of type `iostate`). return void   |
| s.setstate(flags)          | Adds specified condition(s) to s. return void                        |
| s.rdstate()                | returns current condition of s as a stream::iostate value            |

##### Interrogating the state of a stream

`iostate` is a type used to convey information about the state of a stream,  
it is used as a collection of bits,  
the IO classes define four `constexpr` values to represent the states.

 - determine the overall state of a stream is to use either `good` or `fail`

i.e. turns off fialbit and badbit but all other bits unchanged:  
`cin.clear(cin.rdstate() & ~cin.failbit & ~cin.badbit);`

#### 8.1.3 Managing the Output Buffer

The system might store the data in a buffer to be printed later.  
Several conditions that cause the buffer to be flushed:
 - the program completes normally. All output buffers flushed as part of return from main
 - the buffer can become full at some indeterminate time.
 - flush the buffer explicitly using a manipulator `endl` (new line and flush) `flush` (just flush) `ends` (writes a null and flush)
 - using the `unitbuf` manipulator to set the stream's internal state to empty the buffer after each output operation. (`unitbuf` is default for `cerr`)  
`cout << unitbuf;` `cout << nounitbuf;`
 - An output stream might be tied to another stream. by default, `cin` and `cerr` are both tied to `cout`. hence, reading `cin` or writing to `cerr`flushes `cout`  
`cin.tie(&cout);`

### 8.2 File Input and Output

###### `fstream`-Specific Operations

|                           |                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fstream fstrm;`          | creates an unbound file stream                                                                               |
| `fstream fstrm(s);`       | creates an fstream and opens the file named s. s can be `string` or C char string                            |
| `fstream fstrm(s, mode);` | open s in the given mode                                                                                     |
| `fstrm.open(s)`           | opens the file by the s and bind it to fstrm                                                                 |
| `fstrm.open(s, mode)`     | returns void                                                                                                 |
| `fstrm.close()`           | closes the file to which fstrm is bound. returns void                                                        |
| `fstrm.is_open()`         | return bool indicating whether the file associated with fstrm was sucessfully opened and has not been closed |

#### 8.2.1 Using File Stream Objects

`C++11` allows file name to be string or C char string rather than only the latter.

##### The `open` and `close` members

Once a file stream has been opened, it remains associated with the specified file.  
call open on a file stream that is already open will fial.  
To associate a file stream with a different file, must close the existing file.

##### Automatic construction and destruction

> When an fstream object is destroyed, close() is called automatically.

#### 8.2.2 File Modes

###### File Modes

|        |                                                                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| in     | open for input (only for ifstream and fstream)                               |
| out    | open for output (only for ofstream and fstream) default trunc                |
| app    | seek to the end before every write (always opened in output mode if set app) |
| ate    | seek to the end immediately after the open (combined with other mode)        |
| trunc  | truncate the file (only when out is also set)                                |
| binary | do IO operations in binary mode (combined with other mode)                   |

##### Opening a file in out mode discards existing data

`ofstream out("file", ofstream::app);`

##### File mode is determined each time open is called

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3 `string` Streams

###### `stringstream`-Specified Operations

|                    |                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sstream strm;`    | strm is an unbound stringstream              |
| `sstream strm(s);` | strm holds a copy of the strings s           |
| `strm.str()`       | returns a copy of the string that strm holds |
| `strm.str(s)`      | copies the string s into strm. returns void  |

#### 8.3.1 Using an `istringstream`

> An `istringstream` is often used when we have some work to do on an entire line, and other work to do with individual words within a line.

#### 8.3.2 Using `ostringstream`s

> An `ostringstream` is useful when we need to build up our output a little at a time but donot want to print the output until later.
